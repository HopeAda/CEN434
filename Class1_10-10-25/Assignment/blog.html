         <p>Child marriage remains one of the most heartbreaking realities in many parts of the world. It happens when a child, usually a girl, is married before the age of 18. Families may believe they are protecting their daughters or securing their future, but in truth, child marriage takes away everything that makes childhood precious. It denies education, freedom, and the simple right to grow up without adult burdens.</p>
         <h2>A Childhood Cut Short</h2>
         <p>Imagine being only thirteen or fourteen and suddenly expected to run a home, care for a husband, or even raise children. That is the cruel reality for many girls who are married too soon. Instead of attending school or playing with friends, they are forced into responsibilities they are not ready for. Their dreams fade away quietly, replaced by fear and exhaustion.

Most of these marriages are not acts of love. They are decisions made under pressure, often because of poverty, cultural expectations, or the belief that marriage will provide safety. In the end, the child loses her voice, her choices, and sometimes her life.</p>
         <h2>The Harsh Consequences</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Health problems: 
Early marriage usually leads to early pregnancy. A young girlâ€™s body is not ready for childbirth, and many suffer serious complications. Some lose their lives during pregnancy or delivery, while others are left with long-term health issues.</li>
            <li>End of education: 
Once married, most girls drop out of school. Without education, their chances of escaping poverty become very slim. They are also less likely to understand their rights or make informed decisions about their own health and family.
</li>
            <li>Emotional pain: 
Being forced into marriage at a young age causes deep emotional scars. Many girls feel trapped, isolated, and hopeless. They are robbed of joy, self-confidence, and the simple experiences that help shape who they are.</li>
            <li>Violation of human rights: 
Every child deserves protection, education, and freedom. Child marriage breaks all of these rights. It turns what should be a time of learning and growth into a life of struggle.
</li>
         </ol>
         <h2>Culture Is Not an Excuse</h2>
         <p>Some defend child marriage by saying it is part of tradition or religion. But no tradition should ever justify harm. Culture should help people thrive, not keep them in pain. As societies grow and learn, harmful practices must be questioned and changed. Protecting children should always come before cultural pride.</p>
         <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>
         <p>Ending child marriage requires more than laws on paper. It demands awareness, education, and community support. Families must understand that sending a girl to school protects her future far better than marrying her off early. Governments must enforce laws that set 18 as the legal age of marriage. Communities can create programs that support families in poverty, reducing the pressure to marry off daughters for financial reasons.</p>
         <p>Girls themselves need safe spaces where they can learn, share their voices, and believe in their worth. When girls are educated and empowered, entire communities become stronger and more prosperous.</p>
         <h2>A Hope for the Future</h2>
         <p>Child marriage should have no place in our world. Every child deserves the chance to play, learn, and grow before taking on adult responsibilities. When we protect girls, we protect the future. Saying no to child marriage means saying yes to education, safety, and equality. It means choosing hope over fear.

Let every child be free to live her childhood with joy and dignity. That is a future worth fighting for.</p>
